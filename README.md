# My Portfolio

This project was made to create a portfolio to display my recent projects, skills, and previous work experience. 

## Features
- Most of the things on the portfolio (About, Experience, Skills, Projects) are all being used from public JSON files. With this there is no need to rebuild the project to add a new skill or include a new project or work experience.
- Header tracks which part of the site you've scrolled to and updates based upon where you are on the site.
- Able to directly contact me via email from the site & download latest resumes.
