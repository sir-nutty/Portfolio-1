  "about": "I was an application support team member in my past life. Now I'm going on a new journey in front end development. I've worked 7 years in the technical field providing support for such companies as Credit Suisse & Versace. After many years of support it's time for a change, so I'm diving into the world of programming. I'm looking for exciting opportunities to display my skills in front end development.",
